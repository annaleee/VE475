## How to use
First, open the terminal, enter into the file directory, and type:

```g++ -o test.out main.cpp -lgmpxx -lgmp```
``./test.out      ``
if the last line is:"you are right" then the program succeed
## Principles
This program take two random large integers and calculate the gcd of them with Encludien Algorithm. Finally, we compare the result of our implementation with the internal functions of GMP package.
